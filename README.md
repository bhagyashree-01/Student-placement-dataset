✱ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Student Placement dataset using Python (Jupyter Notebook). The dataset was cleaned, processed, and explored to extract meaningful insights related to student demographics, academic performance, and placement outcomes.
The final goal of this project is to present these insights through a student placement dashboard that helps understand placement trends and key factors influencing employability.

✱ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following data cleaning operations were performed:
•Handling missing and null values
•Removing duplicate records
•Data type conversions
•Standardizing categorical variables
•Feature selection and transformation
These steps ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

✱Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key EDA operations include:
•Descriptive statistics of student attributes
•Distribution analysis (salary, CGPA, experience, etc.)
•Placement vs non-placement comparison
•Gender, education, and specialization-wise analysis
•Correlation analysis between academic scores and placement status

✱Dashboard Insights
The dashboard highlights:
•Overall placement percentage
•Average and highest salary offered
•Placement trends by gender and specialization
•Impact of academic performance on placements
•Company-wise and role-wise hiring insights

✱Tools & Technologies
•Python
•Jupyter Notebook
•Pandas, NumPy
•Matplotlib / Seaborn

🎯 Objective
To provide a data-driven view of student placements that can help:
•Students understand employability factors
•Institutions analyze placement performance
•Recruiters identify talent trends
